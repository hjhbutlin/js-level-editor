<h1>2D puzzle-platformer game & level designer in JS</h1>

<mark><i>Work in progress</i></mark>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I wanted to refresh my HTML CSS JS basics, as well as try my hand at creating a complex level editor while keeping the UI simple and easy to use.

<h2>Built So far...</h2>
- Base game physics
- Some example levels
- The base level editor
